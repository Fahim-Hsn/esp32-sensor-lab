# ðŸŒ¤ DHT11 Weather Display with IÂ²C LCD (ESP32)

This is a simple project that turns your ESP32 into a mini weather station.  
It reads the temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and shows them on a 16Ã—2 LCD with an IÂ²C interface.

---

## ðŸ“º What Youâ€™ll See
The LCD updates every few seconds:
1. A short message: **"Today's Weather..."**  
2. The current temperature in Â°C  
3. The current humidity in %  

Itâ€™s a quick way to check the roomâ€™s climate at a glance.

## ðŸ›  What You Need
- **ESP32 board** (e.g., ESP32 DevKit V1)  
- **DHT11 sensor** (temperature & humidity)  
- **16Ã—2 LCD with IÂ²C module** (PCF8574)  
- Jumper wires  
- USB cable to connect ESP32 to your computer

## ðŸ”Œ Wiring

### DHT11 â†’ ESP32
- **VCC** â†’ 3.3V (or 5V)  
- **GND** â†’ GND  
- **DATA** â†’ GPIO **4**  

### LCD (IÂ²C) â†’ ESP32
- **VCC** â†’ 5V  
- **GND** â†’ GND  
- **SDA** â†’ GPIO **21**  
- **SCL** â†’ GPIO **22**  

> ESP32 SDA/SCL pins can be changed in code if needed.  
> If your LCD shows nothing, try a different IÂ²C address (0x27 or 0x3F).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install Libraries** in Arduino IDE:  
   - `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit  
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C` by Frank de Brabander (or similar)

2. **Open the Code** in Arduino IDE:  
   - Check that the DHT pin (GPIO 4) matches your wiring.  
   - Make sure the LCD IÂ²C address (0x27) is correct for your module.  
   - Select your ESP32 board and COM port.  
   - Click **Upload**.

3. **See It Work**:  
   - The LCD will show `"Today's Weather..."` for a moment, then display temperature and humidity.  
   - It refreshes every few seconds.

## âš™ How It Works
1. **Setup** â€“ The ESP32 starts the LCD and DHT11 sensor.  
2. **Read Data** â€“ The ESP32 asks the DHT11 for temperature and humidity.  
3. **Show on LCD** â€“ First shows a welcome message, then the readings.  

---

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting
- **Blank LCD** â€“ Check wiring, try changing IÂ²C address, or run an IÂ²C scanner sketch.  
- **NaN Readings** â€“ Check DHT11 wiring and ensure youâ€™re using the correct library.  
- **Screen Flicker** â€“ Reduce `lcd.clear()` calls or add longer delays.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas to Improve
- Use a **DHT22** for more accurate readings.  
- Add more sensors (light, pressure, etc.) and cycle them on the LCD.  
- Send data to a web page or app using ESP32â€™s Wi-Fi.
